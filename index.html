      <p>I am currently a post-doc at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra with <a href="https://www.isidorastojanovic.com/">Isidora Stojanovic </a> on the ERC Advance Grant Project Valence Asymmetries. </p>

      <p>My research interests include pragmatics, psycholinguistics, language acquisition and learnability, Cognitive Science, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of language. In particular, I'm interested in the interaction between linguistic representations and other areas of cognition, and what that reveals about cognitive architecture (although, that's a difficult question). </p>
    </div>


    <div>
      <p>Before that, I worked with <a href="https://lettres.sorbonne-universite.fr/personnes/anouch-bourmayan">Anouch Bourmayan </a> (Sorbonne), <a href="https://www.isidorastojanovic.com/">Isidora Stojanovic </a> (UPF / Institut Jean Nicod, ENS / EHESS / CNRS), and <a href="http://www.brentstrickland.net/">Brent Strickland </a> (Institut Jean Nicod, ENS / EHESS / CNRS). This project is a cross between linguistics, philosophy, and cognitive science looking at the significance of affective information in language processing. </p>
 
      <p>Before THAT, I worked with  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/iranoveck/home">Ira Noveck</a> at the <a href="http://www.llf.cnrs.fr/">Laboratoire de linguistique formelle</a> (CNRS / Universit&eacute Paris-Cit&eacute) on a project about the semantics and pragmatics of discourse connectives.</p>

      <p>Before before before, I was an NSF-SPRF fellow working with <a href="https://thegricean.github.io">Judith Degen</a> in the <a href="http://alpslab.stanford.edu/">ALPS lab</a> looking at the semantics and pragmatics of (non-)exhaustivity in wh-questions using corpus-based and computational methods. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>I defended my dissertation in <a href="https://ling.rutgers.edu/">Linguistics at Rutgers University</a> in July 2020. My dissertation, "The question of questions: resolving (non-)exhaustivity in wh-questions" was an experimental investigation of the semantics and pragmatics of (non-)exhaustivity. My chair was <a href="https://sites.rutgers.edu/kristen-syrett/">Kristen Syrett</a>, and the committee included Veneeta Dayal, Paul Pietroski, Yimei Xiang, and Alex Lascarides (external).</p>

      <p>I was a member of the <a href="http://languagestudies.rutgers.edu/">Laboratory for Developmental Language Studies</a>, directed by Kristen Syrett. I received a Certificate in Cognitive Science through the <a href="http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers Center for Cognitive Science</a>. </p>

      <p>I also worked with <a href="http://sites.rutgers.edu/tesar/">Bruce Tesar</a> on the learnability of prosodic systems. I explore the challenge of maintaining restrictiveness in the face of paradigmatic subsets, and propose an inductive solution using Tesar's (2014) Output-Driven Learning Algorithm which solves this problem by exploiting neutralizations evident from a language's phonotactic distribution.</p>

    <div>
      <p>In undergrad I studied Linguisitcs, Philosophy and French at University of Maryland, College Park. I was a research assistant at the <a href="http://ling.umd.edu/research/acquisition_lab/">Project on Children&#39;s Language Learning</a> at the <a href="http://ling.umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a>. I worked there on several projects with <a href="http://ling.umd.edu/~hacquard/">Valentine Hacquard </a> and <a href="http://ling.umd.edu/~jlidz/">Jeff Lidz</a> on the acquisition of the semantics/pragmatics of attitude verbs. </p>

      <p>I dropped out of college and had many different jobs, including selling books, editing concert footage, waitressing at a hookah cafe. The most serious of which was in floral design, which I did for about five years. </p>

      <p>I like to read and I also write poetry and short stories.  </p>
