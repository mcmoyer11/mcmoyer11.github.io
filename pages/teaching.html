  Affect is fundamental to how humans think and communicate, yet its role in language and cognition has often been overlooked. This course offers a focused introduction to the experimental and theoretical study of affect, combining contemporary perspectives from linguistics, psychology, and philosophy. Students will be introduced to core experimental methods of affect used across both the linguistics and psychology disciplines as part of an exploration of research methodology (e.g., reaction time tasks, implicit measures including priming, lexical decision paradigms, acceptability tasks, corpus analyses, and a brief discussion of neuroimaging), with attention given both to design elements (e.g., materials, power) and analysis (e.g., models, practical execution). The course includes a practical component, where students will apply the knowledge through a (mini) study replication, involving data collection, analysis, and visualisation. The toolkits for this practicum include PCIbex, R Studio. This course will help students design, execute and evaluate experiments involving affective variables.
